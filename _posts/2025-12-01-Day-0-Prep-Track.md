## General Rules


Breaking any of the following rules will result in elimination from the event:

* .tryhackme.com and the OpenVPN server are off-limits to probing, scanning, or exploiting
* Users are only authorised to hack machines deployed in the rooms they have access to
* Users are not to target or attack other users
* Users should only enter the event once, using one account
* Regular AoC Days: Do not share questions, but permissible to show in videos or streams
* Side quests: Do not share questions, or hints, including not sharing it in videos or streams
* Cheating
* Usage of bot accounts


For the prize raffle terms and conditions, please visit [this page](https://help.tryhackme.com/en/articles/8537472-advent-of-cyber-2025-terms-and-condition#h_cf456f7960).

Please note: Cheating is NOT allowed and will result in a disqualification from the Advent of Cyber event. All winners **will** be fully verified. This includes, in particular:

* creating puppet accounts to inflate your chance to win
* using bots to auto-complete the answers in the room

## How To Qualify

To qualify for the main prizes, you must complete the rooms in the Advent of Cyber 2025 event, starting with Day 1. Only room completions in the Advent of Cyber 2025 roadmap will qualify you for the raffle.

* It doesn't matter when you complete rooms. You just need to complete them by 31st December 2025. For example, if you complete Day 1 on 31st December 2025, you will still receive the same amount of raffle tickets as a user who completes on the day of the task release!
* You don't have to complete all the rooms or complete them in order. The more rooms you complete, the more raffle tickets you get and the higher your chances of winning.

## Certificate

Finally, if you complete every room in the event, you will earn a certificate of completion! As your name will be included on the certificate, we advise ensuring your full name is set (and updated) in [your profile](https://tryhackme.com/manage-account/account-details).

## Task 2

How to use TryHackMe

## A short TryHackMe tutorial


New tasks are released daily at 4pm GMT, with the first challenge being released on 1st December all aimed at beginners. Each task in the event will include instructions on how to interact with the practical material. Please follow them carefully! The instructions will include a connection card similar to the one shown below:


 ![connection card](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763550621401.png)


Let's work our way through the different options.


**If the AttackBox option is available:**


TryHackMe's AttackBox is **an Ubuntu Virtual Machine hosted in the cloud**. Think of the AttackBox as your virtual computer, which you would use to conduct a security engagement. There will be multiple tasks during the event that will ask you to deploy the AttackBox.


You can deploy the AttackBox by clicking the "Start AttackBox" button at the top of this page.


 ![Start Attackbox button](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551029856.png)


Using the web-based AttackBox, you can complete exercises through your browser. If you're a regular user, you can deploy the AttackBox **for free for 1 hour a day.** If you're [subscribed](https://tryhackme.com/why-subscribe), you can deploy it for an unlimited amount of time!


Please note that you can use your own attacker machine instead of the AttackBox. In that case, you will need to connect using OpenVPN. Instructions on how to set up OpenVPN are [here](https://help.tryhackme.com/en/collections/3664918-openvpn-guide).


You can open the AttackBox full-screen view in a new tab using this button:


 ![The full screen button is located in the bottom left corner of the split screen window](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/60909fb1f01099ca375e787ddc48789e.png)


**If the VM option is available:**


Most tasks in Advent of Cyber will have a virtual machine attached to them. You will use some of them as targets to train your offensive security skills and some of them as hosts for your analysis and investigations. If this option is available, you need to click the "Start Machine" button.


 ![Start machine button](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551072512.png)


After the machine is deployed, you will see a frame appear at the top of the room. It will display some important information, like the IP address of the target machine, as well as options to extend the machine's timer or terminate it.

  ![Active machine information](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551112625.png)

**If the split-screen option is available:**


Some tasks will allow you to view your deployed VM in a split-screen view. Typically, if this option is enabled, the split screen will open automatically. If it doesn't, you can click this button at the top of the page for the split screen to open.


 ![Show split view button](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551146629.png)


Please note that you can open split-screen virtual machines in another tab using this button:


 ![The full screen button is located in the bottom left corner of the split screen window](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/38e87a57b989140607a374e7ee487f81.png)


**If there's a direct link available:**


Some virtual machines allow you to view the necessary content directly in another tab on your browser. In this case, you'll be able to see a link to the virtual machine directly in the task content.


 ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/b0a5b7d20824326444979a77ff269b33.png)


Please note that for the link to work, you first need to deploy the virtual machine attached to the task.


**If there is a direct connection option available:**


Some tasks will allow you to connect to the virtual machines attached using RDP, SSH, or VNC. This is always optional, and virtual machines with this enabled will also be accessible via a split screen. In these cases, login credentials will be provided, like in the image below:


 ![Credentials](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551178426.png)


We provide this as some users might prefer to connect directly. However, please note that some tasks will deliberately have this option disabled. If no credentials are given, direct connection is not possible. Now that the admin is out of the way, are you ready to get warmed up for this year's event?

## Let's Get Warmed Up


The snow has started falling in **Wareville**, home of *The Best Festival Company (TBFC)*. The team is preparing for SOCMAS, the annual cyber celebration, but something’s not right. Systems are glitching, passwords are failing, and McSkidy suspects something is afoot. This name keeps coming up: **King Malhare**. What could it mean?


Before joining the **SOCMAS Response Team**, you can complete **10 short missions** to ensure you are ready. Each one teaches an essential cyber security skill and uncovers clues to help get you ready for Advent of Cyber 2025.


 


 ![McSkidy warming her hands by a fire](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763127196624.png)

Challenge 1 — Password Pandemonium

                                      ![Task banner](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763127292315.png)


## Password Pandemonium


As you log into your new TBFC workstation, an alert pops up:


> “*Weak passwords detected on 73 TBFC accounts!*”


Even McSkidy’s password, `P@ssw0rd123`, has been flagged. Before gaining full access, you’ll need to prove your password prowess.


Strong passwords are one of the simplest yet most effective defences against cyber attacks.


**Objective:** \n Create a password that passes all system checks and isn’t found in the leaked password list.


**Steps:**



1. Enter a password with at least 12 characters.
2. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3. Ensure it isn’t in the breach database.

## The Suspicious Chocolate.exe


A shiny USB labelled **“SOCMAS Party Playlist”** appears on your desk. Inside is a mysterious file called `chocolate.exe`. \n It looks festive, but who sent it?


In this challenge, you’ll scan the file using a simulated VirusTotal tool to decide whether it’s safe or malicious. \n Checking suspicious files is a crucial skill for every defender.


**Objective:** \n Determine if `chocolate.exe` is safe or infected.


**Steps:**



1. Click the “Scan” Button.
2. Review the scan report (49 clean results, 1 malicious).
3. Decide correctly whether the file is safe or dangerous.

## Welcome to the AttackBox!


You step into TBFC’s **AttackBox**, a secure virtual environment built for training. The system hums quietly, waiting for your first command.


This is where defenders learn, break, and rebuild safely. Getting comfortable with the command line is your first step toward cyber mastery.


**Objective:** \n Find and read the hidden welcome message inside your AttackBox.


**Steps:**



1. Use `ls` to list files.
2. Use `cd challenges/` to change directories.
3. Use `cat welcome.txt` to read the text file.

## The CMD Conundrum


McSkidy’s workstation shows signs of tampering, suspicious files moved, logs wiped, and a strange folder named `mystery_data`.


It’s time to use the **Windows Command Prompt** to uncover what’s hidden. \n Learning these commands helps you investigate systems and find what the GUI can’t.


**Objective:** \n Find the hidden flag file using Windows commands.


**Steps:**



1. Use `dir` to list visible files.
2. Try `dir /a` to reveal hidden ones.
3. Use `type hidden_flag.txt` to read the flag.

## Linux Lore


TBFC’s delivery drones are glitching, dropping eggs instead of presents! McSkidy’s last login came from a Linux server, and something in his account might explain why.


Linux powers most servers worldwide, and knowing how to search within it is a must for any defender.


**Objective:** \n Locate McSkidy’s hidden message in his Linux home directory.


**Steps:**



1. Use `cd /home/mcskidy/` to enter his folder.
2. Run `ls -la` to show all files.
3. Use `cat .secret_message` to reveal the flag.

## The Leak in the List


Rumours swirl that TBFC’s data has been leaked. Emails are bouncing, and the staff are panicking. \n McSkidy suspects his account might have been part of a breach.


Defenders often use tools like **Have I Been Pwned** to check for compromised accounts. Early detection can stop an attack from spreading.


**Objective:** \n Check if McSkidy’s email has appeared in a breach.


**Steps:**



1. Enter `mcskidy@tbfc.com` into the breach checker.
2. Review results for each domain.
3. Identify the one marked “Compromised.”

## WiFi Woes in Wareville


The TBFC drones are looping endlessly over Wareville Square. Someone logged into the company router using default credentials!


Securing WiFi is critical. Default passwords are like leaving the front gate wide open.


**Objective:** \n Log into the router and secure it with a strong new password.


**Steps:**



1. Log in with username `admin` and password `admin`.
2. Go to “Security Settings.”
3. Set a new strong password that passes validation.

## The App Trap


McSkidy’s social account has gone rogue, posting strange messages about “EASTMAS.” A suspicious third party app may be behind it.


Learning to review and manage app permissions helps stop data leaks before they start.


**Objective:** \n Find and remove the malicious connected app.


**Steps:**



1. Review the list of connected apps.
2. Look for one with unusual permissions (like “password vault” access).
3. Click “Revoke Access.”

## The Chatbot Confession


TBFC’s AI assistant, **FestiveBot**, was meant to help write cheerful emails, but it’s been spilling secrets. \n Some messages reveal internal URLs and even passwords.


AI tools can be powerful, but defenders must know how to prevent them from oversharing.


**Objective:** \n Identify which chatbot messages contain sensitive information.


**Steps:**



1. Read each line of the conversation.
2. Select the ones containing private data.
3. Submit your findings.

## The Bunny’s Browser Trail


SOCMAS web servers are showing heavy traffic, but one log entry stands out:


> “*User Agent: BunnyOS/1.0 (HopSecBot)*”


Someone or something has infiltrated the system. \n User Agent strings help defenders spot automated or suspicious visitors in network logs.


**Objective:** \n Find the unusual User Agent in the HTTP log.


**Steps:**



1. Read the provided web log entries.
2. Compare them to common browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Identify and select the suspicious entry.
